		<h3>A Scheduling Problem</h3>
		<p>The below is some commentary, reflection, and an implementation of a problem from: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UCSanDiegoX+ALGS201x+2T2017. While this is probably against some terms of service or honor code, *shrug*. Since I've been doing other things that are not writing those algorithms posts I've been meaning to, this is me somewhat making it up to myself. Since really the whole goal of these writings is to orthogaphically manifest thought.</p>
		<pre><code>
/*
  The basic idea of this problem is: given a set of threads, and a sequence of jobs that take some variable amount of time. When does which thread begin work on each job.
  The original approach I took involved allocating runs, which was a job thread pair and a little metadata. This allowed one to keep track of which threads were busy and with what. However, this allocation process required a corresponding deallocation step in which I "freed" the threads and printed when they began a certain task. Keeping a deque of running jobs, freeing threads upon completion, and printing the task start after the fact was a rather circuitious way to solve the above problem. Moreover, the added complexity made bugs hard to squash since the data structure used for keeping track of running jobs changes as different problems were found.

A key ideas for this problem was realizing that until the threadpool is emptied, time doesn't move forward since each thread has to be assigned a task "simultaniously" and that one didn't need to keep track of what was running where, but only when will a given thread be free next. The former significantly simplfied the time keeping and thread "freeing", and the later allowed one to not worry about "completing" jobs and focus only on when the next job could start.

(Some) things learned:
* thinking about the problem deeply is good, but sometimes reading into it too deeply leads to complicated solutions that obscure the actual task at hand.
* every malloc needs a free (thank you valgrind).
* Similiar to the first point, understanding how to calculate the output before youtry and programmatically compute it is a good idea.
* Ensure your base data structures are well tested before venturing out into the wild
